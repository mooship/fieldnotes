## Design

Swiss / International Typographic style: pure black-on-white, one hot signal-red accent, sharp corners, hairline rules, a flush-left ragged-right grid. No shadows, no gradients, no italics. Dark mode is CSS-only via `prefers-color-scheme` — there's no toggle, no stored preference, no flash of the wrong theme.

## Performance & privacy

No tracking scripts beyond [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/), which is cookieless and doesn't fingerprint. The carbon badge in the footer of every page is computed entirely client-side from the Performance API using the [Sustainable Web Design Model](https://sustainablewebdesign.org) — nothing is sent anywhere to produce it.

## Source

The whole site is open source: [github.com/mooship/fieldnotes](https://github.com/mooship/fieldnotes), MIT licensed. If something looks broken, that repo is where to say so.
